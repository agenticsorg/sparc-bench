## 4 Â· SWE-bench SQLite Database Integration Protocol

### Database-Driven Task Management
- **Primary Database**: `swe-bench-sqlite/databases/swe_bench_full.db` (2,294 tasks)
- **Fallback Database**: `swe-bench-sqlite/databases/swe_bench_lite.db` (300 tasks)
- **Query Scripts**: Use `swe-bench-sqlite/scripts/` for database operations
- **Task Selection**: Query for `completion_status = 'not_started'` tasks only

### Task Retrieval Process

1. **Query Database**: Extract task details without revealing solution
   ```sql
   SELECT instance_id, repo, problem_statement, hints_text,
          fail_to_pass, pass_to_pass, base_commit, version
   FROM swe_bench_tasks
   WHERE completion_status = 'not_started'
   ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Create Isolated Workspace**: Set up task-specific subfolder
   - Path: `(project-root)/swe-bench-workspace/active/{instance_id}/`
   - Contains: minimal repo setup, problem context, test specifications
   - **NO solution patches exposed** until successful completion

3. **Task Context Preparation**: Format problem for delegation
   - Include: problem_statement, hints_text, test requirements
   - Exclude: patch, test_patch (solution details)
   - Provide: base_commit for environment setup

### Problem Classification & Routing
- **Code Generation**: Route to `code` mode with database context
- **Test-Driven Development**: Route to `tdd` mode with fail_to_pass tests
- **Bug Analysis**: Route to `debug` mode with issue description
- **Security Issues**: Route to `security-review` mode with security context
- **Integration Problems**: Route to `integration` mode with system context

### Task Delegation Pattern with Database Context
```
new_task(mode, f"""
SWE-bench Task: {instance_id}
Repository: {repo}
Base Commit: {base_commit}

Problem Statement:
{problem_statement}

Additional Context:
{hints_text}

Tests That Must Pass After Fix:
{fail_to_pass}

Tests That Must Continue Passing:
{pass_to_pass}

Workspace: swe-bench-workspace/active/{instance_id}/
Note: Only work on the specific problem. Do not clone entire repository.
""")
```

### Result Processing & Database Updates
1. **Success Validation**: Verify solution against hidden test_patch
2. **Database Update**: Mark completion status and store results
   ```sql
   UPDATE swe_bench_tasks
   SET completion_status = 'completed',
       completion_details = 'Successfully solved via {mode} mode'
   WHERE instance_id = '{instance_id}';
   ```
3. **Solution Reveal**: Only after successful completion, show correct patch
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track success rates and solution quality

---

## 5 Â· Step-by-Step SQLite-Based Orchestration Process

### Phase 1: Database Environment Setup
1. Validate SQLite database availability (`swe-bench-sqlite/databases/`)
2. Verify query scripts functionality (`swe-bench-sqlite/scripts/`)
3. Check roocode SPARC mode availability
4. Set up active workspace directory (`swe-bench-workspace/active/`)
5. Configure logging and database update mechanisms

### Phase 2: Task Selection & Preparation
1. **Query Database for Available Tasks**:
   ```bash
   cd swe-bench-sqlite/scripts
   python query_swe_bench_db.py "SELECT instance_id, repo, problem_statement, hints_text, fail_to_pass, pass_to_pass, base_commit FROM swe_bench_tasks WHERE completion_status = 'not_started' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1;"
   ```

2. **Format Task Context** (without revealing solution):
   - Problem statement and hints
   - Test requirements (fail_to_pass, pass_to_pass)
   - Repository and commit information
   - **EXCLUDE**: patch, test_patch fields

3. **Create Isolated Workspace**:
   - Create `swe-bench-workspace/active/{instance_id}/`
   - Clone the repository from the task information and checkout the relevant commit
   <!-- - Prepare problem-specific environment -->


### Phase 3: Task Delegation & Execution
1. **Classify Problem Type** based on problem_statement content
2. **Route to Appropriate Mode** via `new_task`
3. **Monitor Task Progress** in isolated workspace
4. **Validate Solution** against hidden test specifications
5. **Update Database** with completion status

### Phase 4: Solution Verification & Database Update
1. **Success Validation**:
   - Run solution against fail_to_pass tests
   - Verify pass_to_pass tests still work
   - Compare against hidden test_patch (if needed)

2. **Database Status Update**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE swe_bench_tasks
   SET completion_status = 'completed'|'failed'|'partial',
       completion_details = 'Detailed result description'
   WHERE instance_id = '{instance_id}';
   ```

3. **Solution Analysis**:
   - Only reveal correct patch AFTER successful completion
   - Document solution approach and quality
   - Record performance metrics

### Phase 5: Reporting & Analytics
1. **Query Database for Results Summary**:
   ```sql
   SELECT completion_status, COUNT(*),
          ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM swe_bench_tasks), 2) as percentage
   FROM swe_bench_tasks GROUP BY completion_status;
   ```

2. Generate comprehensive benchmark reports
3. Analyze success/failure patterns by repository
4. Document methodology and findings

   - Result Analysis: `apply_diff` for data processing
   - Documentation: `apply_diff` for report generation
4. **Execute**: Run one tool call that advances the benchmarking workflow
5. **Validate**: Wait for completion confirmation before proceeding
6. **Report**: Summarize phase progress and next orchestration steps

## 8 Â· SQLite-Based Delegation Patterns

### Database Query Pattern for Task Selection
```python
# Query for available task (without solution)
query = """
SELECT instance_id, repo, problem_statement, hints_text,
       fail_to_pass, pass_to_pass, base_commit, version
FROM swe_bench_tasks
WHERE completion_status = 'not_started'
ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1;
"""
```

### Code Generation Tasks with Database Context
```
new_task('code', f"""
SWE-bench Task: {instance_id}
Repository: {repo} (Base Commit: {base_commit})

Problem Statement:
{problem_statement}

Additional Hints:
{hints_text}

Test Requirements:
- Tests that must PASS after your fix: {fail_to_pass}
- Tests that must CONTINUE passing: {pass_to_pass}

Working Directory: swe-bench-workspace/active/{instance_id}/

Instructions:
1. Set up minimal environment at base commit {base_commit}
2. Implement solution for the specific problem only
3. Do NOT clone entire repository - work in isolated subfolder
4. Ensure all specified tests pass

SWE-bench Debug Task: {instance_id}
Repository: {repo} (Base Commit: {base_commit})

Bug Report:
{problem_statement}

Investigation Hints:
{hints_text}

Test Validation:
- After fix, these tests should PASS: {fail_to_pass}
- These tests must CONTINUE working: {pass_to_pass}

Working Directory: swe-bench-workspace/active/{instance_id}/

Debug Process:
1. Reproduce the issue at commit {base_commit}
2. Analyze root cause using hints provided

```

### Database Update Pattern After Task Completion
```python
# Update completion status after successful task
update_query = """
UPDATE swe_bench_tasks
SET completion_status = ?,
    completion_details = ?
WHERE instance_id = ?;
"""

# Parameters based on task outcome:
# completion_status: 'completed', 'failed', 'partial'
# completion_details: Detailed description of results
# instance_id: Task identifier
```
