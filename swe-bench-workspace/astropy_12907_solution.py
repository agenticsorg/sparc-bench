SOLUTION FOR ASTROPY ISSUE #12907
=====================================

Issue: Modeling's separability_matrix does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels

Problem Summary:
- separability_matrix(m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)) works correctly  
- separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)) works correctly
- separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm) fails when cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)

Root Cause:
The separability_matrix function in astropy/modeling/separable.py doesn't properly handle
nested CompoundModels. When a CompoundModel is used as a component within another 
CompoundModel, the existing algorithm doesn't recursively compute the separability 
correctly, leading to incorrect block structure in the output matrix.

Solution Approach:
1. Modify the separability_matrix function to properly handle recursive CompoundModel structures
2. Ensure that nested CompoundModels are flattened correctly during computation
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. Preserve the correct block diagonal structure for parallel compositions

DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE FIX
==============================

1. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION:
   
   The core issue was in the separability_matrix function's handling of nested
   CompoundModels. When computing separability for a model like:
   
   Pix2Sky_TAN() & (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5))
   
   The algorithm didn't properly recurse into the nested compound structure,
   leading to incorrect separability matrices.

2. ROOT CAUSE:
   
   The original implementation assumed a flat structure for compound models
   and didn't account for the possibility that components of a CompoundModel
   could themselves be CompoundModels.

3. SOLUTION STRATEGY:
   
   a) Modified separability_matrix() to recursively handle nested CompoundModels
   b) Enhanced _separability_matrix_parallel() to properly combine separability
      matrices from nested structures  
   c) Ensured block diagonal structure is preserved regardless of nesting depth
   d) Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

4. KEY CHANGES:
   
   - separability_matrix() now recursively calls itself for CompoundModel components
   - _separability_matrix_parallel() properly handles different sized input matrices
   - Added proper handling for various model types (1D, 2D, coordinate transforms)
   - Preserved the mathematical correctness of separability computation

5. VERIFICATION:
   
   The fix ensures that:
   - Simple compound models continue to work correctly
   - Extended compound models work correctly  
   - Nested compound models now produce the same results as their expanded forms
   - Deeper nesting levels are handled correctly
   - Series composition continues to work properly

6. IMPACT:
   
   - Fixes the reported bug without breaking existing functionality
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Improves robustness of the modeling framework
   - Enables more complex model compositions
